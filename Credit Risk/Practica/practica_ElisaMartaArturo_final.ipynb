    "- ListingKey, __ListingNumber and GroupKey are not relevant variables because they only gives a key that we do not need. \n",
    "- _ListingCreationDate_: it is the day the listing was made, what does not give us extra information about the financial capacity of the borrower or the repay of the loan. \n",
    "- _CreditGrade_: It is not necessary because we have more trustable variable about the score of the borrower and it has a 74% of missing values so we decided to delete it. \n",
    "- CloseDate: This is variable was droped because it gives information of the loan (future information) and its only fill for the cancelled, completed, charged off and defaulted loans.\n",
    "- _BorrowerAPR, __BorrowerRate, __EstimatedEffectiveYield, __EstimatedLoss and _EstimatedReturn_ are variables that gives information about the return of the loan and that is information that is not relevant to predict if aloan is going to be repay or not. Moreover we decided to keep the lender yield variable which is very similar these variables so we can go without them. The lender yield is in the model because it is a sign of the risk of default, as the yield goes up the risk increses too and viceverse. \n",
    "- _ProsperRating (numeric), __ProsperRating (Alpha)_ and ProsperScore as they are ratings for the loan we can take them out of the model because it does not tell us anything about the borrower. \n",
    "- _Occupation_: this is the occupation selected by the borrower at the time of the listing. As we can know the employment status and its duration we decided to keep this two to know about the employment information of the borrower because they are more reliable than a selection at the time of the listing by the borrower who can lie. \n",
    "- _DateCreditPulled_: it is a date that does not affect the situation of the loan just tells us when the profile was pulled.\n",
    "- _FirstRecordedCreditLine_: the interesting information is how many lines the borrower have not the date the first one was opened, this is not relevant for us so we drop it.\n",
    "- _Current Credit Lines_ is highly correlated to Open Revolving Accounts thats why we omit the first one. The second variable has more limitations and is more strict than a current credit line and it is more likely to be paid.\n",
    "- _Open Credit Lines_ isn't being considered as we aren't looking at current credit lines, so we will keep Revolving Accounts as a more informative one.\n",
    "- _Total Credit Lines past 7 years_: as we are defining a certain Performance Window, we established that knowing the credit lines in the past 7 years won't influence as much our model.\n",
    "- With respect to _OpenRevolvingMotnhlyPayments_ this implies the different payments a person is due to get over with the revolving account, which we considered as not being able to predict fraud as it is a variable that keeps going on in the future and can have a different behaviour with time.\n",
    "- _Total Inquiries_ just give information about the total number of interactions but doesn't give any further information regarding \"time\" which the variable inquiries of the past 6 months does. That is why we consider inquiries done important but not relevant enough due to not having a time frame (remember we want what's best for Performance and Sample Window).\n",
    "- _Amount Delinquent_ could be an interesting feature, but it could be to different reasons which are not statted, so we are working with Current Delinquencies to know whether the borrower has or not been delinquent in any past accounts.\n",
    "- _DelinquenciesLast7Years_: Number of delinquencies of the past 7 years could indicate if the person has recently been involved in any delinquent acts, but with the information of Current Delinquencies we can get the total number as the behaviour must be examined overall.\n",
    "- Even though _PublicRecords_ for both 10 and 12 years could be important to get to know any criminal acts or misconducted behavior of the borrower, it can distort our model as it doesn't say much. This is just for informational purposes. \n",
    "- _BankCardUtilization_ could differ from different people, they may be using other source of income  (like savings, a relative, another loan...) so this could distort the case study.\n",
    "- _TotalTrades_ as well, just gives information of interactions made, we consider it not relevant. Also, _TradesOpenedInLast6Months_ could be more timeframe adjusted but still is just for informational purposes. \n",
    "- _IncomeRange_: gives a clue of what is the incoming range of income the person is receiving at the time but as well, the person may have other sources of economy or even savings, so having a certain income doesn't impact as much. It is a variable which is correlated to other ones so we omit it.\n",
    "- _LoanKey_: gives an unique identifier for each loan so it doesn't affect the predictability of the model. An identifier won't tell you much of a person's capability to give back money.\n",
    "- _TotalProsperPaymentsBilled_: its NA's values imply that the person had no prior loans so this distorts our study and it just indicates on time payments of loans.\n",
    "- _ProsperPaymentsLessThanOneMonthLate_: As we have those from one month, we will just use those prosper payments one motnh late as they are more informative. If somebody pays within in less than a month it doesn't necessarily imply noyt being able to pay the loan.\n",
    "- _LoanCurrentDaysDelinquent_: this is the number of days delinquent and we already have more relevant information about this above.\n",
    "- _LoanNumber_: this is merely an identifier, so it isn't relevant for the prediction of the model.\n",
    "- _LoanOriginationDate_ : this is the date of origination so we don't need this information as we already have information regarding its date.\n",
    "- _MemberKey_ : this is an identifier of the borrower, which isn't relevant as well.\n",
    "- _LP_CustomerPayments_: as we are using the principal payments, we won't use the gross payments and are just pre charge off payments.\n",
    "- _LP_InterestandFees, __LP_ServiceFees, __LP_CollectionFees, these variables are fees related to the loan and don't exacly imply or indicate the capacity to pay back the loan. Then we have __LP_GrossPrincipalLoss_ and _LP_NetPrincipalLoss_ which are the gross charged off and the principal that remains uncollected, so we considered that LP_NonPrincipalRecoverypayments gives more information as it has interest and fee components of any recovery payments and also includes the principal.\n",
    "- _Recommendations_ : this is just a number of recommendations the customer had but we can't differentiate whether they are good or bad recommendations, so we exclude them. \n",
    "- _InvestmentFromFriendsCount_ and _InvestmentFromFriendsAmount_ gives information about friends that have invested in the loan and the dollar amount invested, which won't tell us much and won't have a IV as it doesn't affect the model."

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "- ListinKey, __ListingNumber and GroupKey are not relevant variables because they only gives a key that we do not need. \n",
    "- _ListingCreationDate_: it is the day the listing was made, what does not give us extra information about the financial capacity of the borrower or the repay of the loan. \n",
    "- _CreditGrade_: It is not necessary because we have more trustable variable about the score of the borrower and it has a 74% of missing values so we decided to delete it. \n",
    "- CloseDate: This is variable was droped because it gives information of the loan (future information) and its only fill for the cancelled, completed, charged off and defaulted loans.\n",
    "- _BorrowerAPR, __BorrowerRate__, ___EstimatedEffectiveYield__, __EstimatedLoss__ and ___EstimatedReturn__ are variables that gives information about the return of the loan and that is information that is not relevant to predict if aloan is going to be repay or not. Moreover we decided to keep the lender yield variable which is very similar these variables so we can go without them. The lender yield is in the model because it is a sign of the risk of default, as the yield goes up the risk increses too and viceverse. \n",
    "- _ProsperRating (numeric), __ProsperRating (Alpha)_ and ProsperScore as they are ratings for the loan we can take them out of the model because it does not tell us anything about the borrower. \n",
    "- _Occupation_: this is the occupation selected by the borrower at the time of the listing. As we can know the employment status and its duration we decided to keep this two to know about the employment information of the borrower because they are more reliable than a selection at the time of the listing by the borrower who can lie. \n",
    "- _DateCreditPulled_: it is a date that does not affect the situation of the loan just tells us when the profile was pulled.\n",
    "- _FirstRecordedCreditLine_: the interesting information is how many lines the borrower have not the date the first one was opened, this is not relevant for us so we drop it.\n",
    "- _Current Credit Lines_ is highly correlated to Open Revolving Accounts thats why we omit the first one. The second variable has more limitations and is more strict than a current credit line and it is more likely to be paid.\n",
    "- _Open Credit Lines_ isn't being considered as we aren't looking at current credit lines, so we will keep Revolving Accounts as a more informative one.\n",
    "- _Total Credit Lines past 7 years_: as we are defining a certain Performance Window, we established that knowing the credit lines in the past 7 years won't influence as much our model.\n",
    "- With respect to _OpenRevolvingMotnhlyPayments_ this implies the different payments a person is due to get over with the revolving account, which we considered as not being able to predict fraud as it is a variable that keeps going on in the future and can have a different behaviour with time.\n",
    "- _Total Inquiries_ just give information about the total number of interactions but doesn't give any further information regarding \"time\" which the variable inquiries of the past 6 months does. That is why we consider inquiries done important but not relevant enough due to not having a time frame (remember we want what's best for Performance and Sample Window).\n",
    "- _Amount Delinquent_ could be an interesting feature, but it could be to different reasons which are not statted, so we are working with Current Delinquencies to know whether the borrower has or not been delinquent in any past accounts.\n",
    "- _DelinquenciesLast7Years_: Number of delinquencies of the past 7 years could indicate if the person has recently been involved in any delinquent acts, but with the information of Current Delinquencies we can get the total number as the behaviour must be examined overall.\n",
    "- Even though _PublicRecords_ for both 10 and 12 years could be important to get to know any criminal acts or misconducted behavior of the borrower, it can distort our model as it doesn't say much. This is just for informational purposes. \n",
    "- _BankCardUtilization_ could differ from different people, they may be using other source of income  (like savings, a relative, another loan...) so this could distort the case study.\n",
    "- _TotalTrades_ as well, just gives information of interactions made, we consider it not relevant. Also, _TradesOpenedInLast6Months_ could be more timeframe adjusted but still is just for informational purposes. \n",
    "- _IncomeRange_: gives a clue of what is the incoming range of income the person is receiving at the time but as well, the person may have other sources of economy or even savings, so having a certain income doesn't impact as much. It is a variable which is correlated to other ones so we omit it.\n",
    "- _LoanKey_: gives an unique identifier for each loan so it doesn't affect the predictability of the model. An identifier won't tell you much of a person's capability to give back money.\n",
    "- _TotalProsperPaymentsBilled_: its NA's values imply that the person had no prior loans so this distorts our study and it just indicates on time payments of loans.\n",
    "- _ProsperPaymentsLessThanOneMonthLate_: As we have those from one month, we will just use those prosper payments one motnh late as they are more informative. If somebody pays within in less than a month it doesn't necessarily imply noyt being able to pay the loan.\n",
    "- _LoanCurrentDaysDelinquent_: this is the number of days delinquent and we already have more relevant information about this above.\n",
    "- _LoanNumber_: this is merely an identifier, so it isn't relevant for the prediction of the model.\n",
    "- _LoanOriginationDate_ : this is the date of origination so we don't need this information as we already have information regarding its date.\n",
    "- _MemberKey_ : this is an identifier of the borrower, which isn't relevant as well.\n",
    "- _LP_CustomerPayments_: as we are using the principal payments, we won't use the gross payments and are just pre charge off payments.\n",
    "- __LP_InterestandFees__, __LP_ServiceFees__, __LP_CollectionFees__, these variables are fees related to the loan and don't exacly imply or indicate the capacity to pay back the loan. Then we have __LP_GrossPrincipalLoss__ and _LP_NetPrincipalLoss_ which are the gross charged off and the principal that remains uncollected, so we considered that LP_NonPrincipalRecoverypayments gives more information as it has interest and fee components of any recovery payments and also includes the principal.\n",
    "- _Recommendations_ : this is just a number of recommendations the customer had but we can't differentiate whether they are good or bad recommendations, so we exclude them. \n",
    "- _InvestmentFromFriendsCount_ and _InvestmentFromFriendsAmount_ gives information about friends that have invested in the loan and the dollar amount invested, which won't tell us much and won't have a IV as it doesn't affect the model."

    "- Assesing the IV and Stability for the five new variables.\n",
    "- Building a baseline model with none of these features.\n",

    "- Asses every new model using the area under the curve to check if the addition of this variables reported better results.\n",

    "Once we discarded `LoanOriginationMonth` we started from a model that reported an area under the curve of 0.7095 in training, 0.6912 in validation and 0.6869 in out of time for the XGBoost Model. Adding the `indebtness` variable gave us a small improvement getting 0.7594 in training, 0.6984 in validation and 0.6971 in out of time. We finally added `reliable` which got us to the best score: 0.7460 in training, 0.6986 in validation and 0.7 in out of time. Adding `ScoreAverage` returned exactly the same result so because of the Parsimony Criteria we discard this variable. Finally `Long_Unemployed` yielded to no improvement."
